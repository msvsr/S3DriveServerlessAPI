**Problems I faced:**
1. SignatureDoesNotMatch in generate_presigned_url.py while using generate_presigned_url
2. Unable to create a new resource/ update if a resource is deleted manually Example: S3 Bucket
3. Scan or Query in dynamodb
4. python mimetypes is not working for xlsx, docx extensions
5. Description length cannot be greater than 1024 in template. Error: Failed to create changeset for the stack: develop, ex: Waiter ChangeSetCreateComplete failed: Waiter encountered a terminal failure state: For expression "Status" we matched expected path: "FAILED" Status: FAILED. Reason: Template format error: 'Description' length is greater than 1024.
